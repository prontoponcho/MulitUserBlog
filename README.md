# MultiUserBlog

This project touched on topics like user account management, cookie authentication, password hashing, form validation, database management, templating with jinja2, google app engine, google datastore, and (probably) more! The server side code is written in Python while the front end code is mostly straight forward HTML/CSS with a little Javascript used for modals.
